# PlayMusicApp
Google&amp;Udacity Android Basics Scholarship - Musical Structure App project

Architect the user experience and technical design of an app to play music for a user.

The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that 
for this project, the app does not actually need to play music. The App includes:
- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in the app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- Creating own Custom Class
- Looping through an ArrayList
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
